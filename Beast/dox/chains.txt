there is a "chained" word, which is useful to create callback chains.

  chained my-chain

  : w0 ... ; my-chain:!latest
  :noname ... ; my-chain:!

when calling "my-chain", all chained words will be called in order, and the
result (so-called "chain result") will be returned.

can use "<num> chain-res!" to set "chain result" from any action word. any
non-zero value will prevent executing all further chained actions. this
value will be returned as a result of chain execution. if no action word
set a result, the "chain result" will be 0.
