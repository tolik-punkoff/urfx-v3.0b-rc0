why this project (and its repository) is called Uroborus, not UrForth?
======================================================================

as with many other things in UrForth, this is just a historical artefact.
UrForth system had several incarnations, and Uroborus target compiler was
created with UrForth/C first. that C version was very different to Beast,
and it still affects Uroborus code: i never rewrote Uroborus to take
advantage of Beast features. it could be done, but i don't see any good
reasons to do it right now.
