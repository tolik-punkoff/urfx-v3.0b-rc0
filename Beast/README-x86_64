i don't have 64-bit system (and don't intend to switch), so i cannot
provide any support for such systems. but i've been told that to run
UrForth/Beast on x86_64, you need to install the following package (in
Debian-based):

  sudo apt-get install libc6-x32

basically, you need x86 (32-bit) support libraries, because UrForth/Beast
is 32-bit app.
