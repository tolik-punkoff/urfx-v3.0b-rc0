UrForth/Beast: Devastator + Succubus: STC self-hosting x86 Forth system.

this is repository with Uroborus target compiler, and UrForth/Beast
system source code.

this system is using Succubus optimising native code compiler. the speed is
comparable with most state-of-the-art optimising Forth compilers (sometimes
Succubus generates better code, sometimes slightly worse). to give you some
base to compare with: generated code is ~2.5 times slower than GCC -O2,
which is more than enough for any practical purposes. especially
considering compilation speed (lightning fast ;-).

UrForth/Beast is TOTALLY NON-STANDARD! don't bother trying to use it. UrF/B
was created to solve some of my real-world needs, and it reflects my vision
of what Forth system should be. i never cared about any "Forth standards",
and i strongly believe that Forth doesn't need any "standardisation", such
attempts only make Forth worser. remember, Forth is about creating a system
*YOU* feel natural to use, not about sticking to some "standard". Forth
extensibility is there for a reason.

moreover, i believe that existing Forth "standards" is the sole reason for
people to percieve Forth as a "toy language". it is totally impossible to
write any serious software in Forth using those so-called "standards".

someday i'll write an essay about UrF/B design, but for now you are on your
own. read the source code, and try to make sense of it.


please, use Fossil repository instead of git mirror! Fossil repository
contains a wiki. the wiki doesn't have much info in it, but...


have fun, and happy hacking
